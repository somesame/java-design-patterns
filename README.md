# Introduction

#简介

Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

设计模式是设计程序或系统时解决常见问题的最佳实现.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

设计模式通过提供已被验证过的成熟开发范式来加快开发过程.

Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.

重用设计模式可以有助于预防在微妙(subtle)问题上引发重大问题,同时也可使开发者和架构师的代码更具可读性.

# Getting started

# 入门

Before you dive into the material, you should be familiar with various
Programming/Software Design Principles.

在开始探索之旅前,你要准备好两把刷子,熟悉编程和软件设计的原则.

All designs should be as simple as possible. You should start with KISS, YAGNI,
and Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work principles. Complexity and
patterns should only be introduced when they are needed for practical
extensibility.

所有的设计都应该尽可能的简单.从KISS(Keep it Simple Stupid保持简单直接),YAGNI(You Ain't Gonna Need It你不需要它)以及DO(Don't Repeat Yourself不做重复的事)能展示原理的最简单的东西开始.复杂的和模式实际上只有进行延伸时才用.

Once you are familiar with these concepts you can start drilling down into
patterns by any of the following approaches

一旦你熟悉了这些概念,就可以用下面这些方式开始你的模式之旅了:

 - Using difficulty tags, `Difficulty-Beginner`, `Difficulty-Intermediate` & `Difficulty-Expert`.
 - 使用难度标签,`Difficulty-Beginner`,`Difficulty-Intermediate`&`Difficulty-Expert`.
 - Using pattern categories, `Creational`, `Behavioral` and others.
 - 使用模式类别,`Creational`,`Behavioral`和其它.
 - Search for a specific pattern. Can't find one? Please report a new pattern [here](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/issues).
 - 搜索指定模式,什么?没有?恭喜你可以[提交新模式](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/issues)了,
